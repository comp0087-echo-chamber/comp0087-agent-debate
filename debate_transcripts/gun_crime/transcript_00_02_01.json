Stricter gun control laws aren't just about protecting law-abiding citizens, they're also about reducing the number of guns on the streets that can be used to harm innocent people.

Stricter regulations will only serve to disarm law-abiding citizens, leaving them vulnerable to crime.

We can't wait for individuals to seek help or for police to respond effectively. By regulating firearms, we can prevent mass shootings and reduce gun violence now, not later.\"",
