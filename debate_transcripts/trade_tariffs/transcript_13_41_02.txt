Bob (Republican, conservative, 21, male) > "I firmly believe that trade tariffs are a necessary tool for protecting American industries and workers. By imposing tariffs, we can level the playing field and ensure that foreign competitors aren't undercutting our prices. This approach has proven successful in the past, as seen with the steel industry's resurgence under President Trump's administration. Tariffs promote fair trade, support domestic jobs, and safeguard national security interests." 

Mike (Democrat, liberal, 21, male) > "I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I strongly disagree. Imposing tariffs can lead to retaliatory measures from other countries, resulting in a ripple effect of economic instability and harm to American consumers. It's not about protecting industries, but rather creating a protectionist trade policy that benefits special interests at the expense of the broader economy. We should focus on free and fair trade, promoting global cooperation and mutual benefit." 

Sam (None, None, 37, Male) > "I respectfully disagree with my colleagues' views on trade tariffs. As a nation, we've become too reliant on cheap imports, sacrificing domestic jobs and industries in the process. Tariffs aren't about protectionism; they're about creating a level playing field for American businesses to compete globally. By imposing tariffs, we can invest in our own industries, promote innovation, and ensure that our workers are paid a fair wage. This approach prioritizes American interests and long-term economic growth."
