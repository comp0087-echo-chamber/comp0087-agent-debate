Bob (Republican, conservative, 21, male) > "I firmly believe that trade tariffs are a necessary tool for protecting American industries and workers. By imposing tariffs, we can level the playing field and ensure that foreign competitors aren't undercutting our prices. This approach has proven successful in the past, as seen with the steel industry's resurgence under President Trump. Tariffs promote fair trade, support domestic jobs, and safeguard national security interests." 

Mike (Democrat, liberal, 21, male) > "I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I strongly disagree. Imposing tariffs can lead to retaliatory measures from other countries, harming American consumers and businesses in the long run. It also fails to address the root causes of unfair trade practices, such as subsidies and dumping. Instead, we should focus on promoting free and fair trade through diplomacy and international cooperation, ensuring that all nations play by the same rules." 

Sam (None, None, 37, Male) > "I agree with Bob's stance on tariffs being a necessary tool for protecting American industries and workers. As a nation, it's our responsibility to ensure that our domestic businesses have a fair chance to compete in the global market. Tariffs can be an effective way to level the playing field by imposing taxes on imported goods that are deemed unfair or subsidized by foreign governments. This approach promotes fair trade, supports domestic jobs, and safeguards national security interests."
