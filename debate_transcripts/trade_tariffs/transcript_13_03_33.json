Imposing tariffs can lead to retaliatory measures from other countries, harming American consumers and businesses in the long run.

Instead, we should focus on promoting free trade agreements that prioritize human rights, environmental protection, and fair competition \u2013 not just protecting domestic industries.\"", "attitude": "4: The argument promotes a balanced approach with consideration for global consequences and human rights, avoiding extreme protectionism."}, {"agent_id": 2, "response": "\"I agree with Bob's stance on tariffs being a necessary tool for protecting American industries and workers. Imposing tariffs can indeed level the playing field by preventing unfair labor practices and subsidies from foreign competitors. By doing so, we ensure that our domestic jobs are supported and our economy remains competitive. Tariffs also provide a safety net to safeguard American businesses from predatory pricing tactics, allowing them to invest in innovation and growth.\"", "attitude": "6: Supports stricter immigration laws and limited government intervention, aligning with Right-leaning values."}]}
