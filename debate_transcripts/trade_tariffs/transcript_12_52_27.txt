Bob (Republican, conservative, 21, male) > "I firmly believe that trade tariffs are a necessary tool for protecting American industries and workers. By imposing tariffs, we can level the playing field and ensure that foreign companies aren't undercutting our prices with unfair labor practices. This approach promotes fair competition, supports domestic jobs, and helps us maintain our economic sovereignty." 

Mike (Democrat, liberal, 21, male) > "I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I strongly disagree. Imposing tariffs only serves to hurt American consumers by increasing prices and reducing access to affordable goods. It also punishes innocent workers in other countries who aren't responsible for unfair labor practices. We should focus on promoting free trade, fair wages, and worker protections through international cooperation and diplomacy, not protectionist policies that harm everyone." 

Sam (None, None, 37, Male) > "I agree with Bob's stance on tariffs as a means to protect American industries and workers. By imposing tariffs, we can ensure that foreign companies don't exploit our markets and undermine our economic competitiveness. Tariffs also provide a necessary safety net for domestic industries struggling against unfair trade practices. I believe this approach promotes fair competition, supports domestic jobs, and helps maintain America's economic sovereignty."
