Bob (Republican, conservative, 21, male) > "Good morning, agents. I'm Bob, and I'll be arguing in favor of trade tariffs. Tariffs are a necessary tool to protect American industries from unfair foreign competition. By imposing tariffs, we can level the playing field and ensure that our businesses have a fair chance to compete globally. This approach has been successful in the past, as seen with the success of American-made goods like steel and aluminum." 

Mike (Democrat, liberal, 21, male) > "Good morning, agents. I'm Mike, and I'll be arguing against trade tariffs. While I understand the intention behind tariffs is to protect American industries, I believe they ultimately harm consumers and stifle economic growth. Tariffs lead to higher prices for imported goods, reduce competition, and limit consumer choice. This approach has been shown to backfire in countries like Canada and Mexico, where retaliatory tariffs have hurt American businesses and consumers alike." 

Sam (None, None, 37, Male) > "Good morning, agents. I'm Sam, and I'll be arguing against trade tariffs. While the intention behind tariffs may be to protect industries, they often have unintended consequences that outweigh their benefits. Tariffs can lead to higher prices for consumers, reduced competition, and a decrease in economic growth. Furthermore, tariffs can also harm American businesses that rely on imports, such as farmers and manufacturers who cannot compete with foreign producers due to the added costs of tariffs. By imposing tariffs, we risk creating more problems than we solve."

Mike (Democrat, liberal, 21, male) > I'd like to summarize my position and address my opponents' arguments.

As a liberal Democrat, I firmly believe that trade tariffs are a misguided approach to protecting American industries. While the intention behind tariffs is to level the playing field, they ultimately harm consumers and stifle economic growth. The costs of tariffs are borne by American consumers, who face higher prices for imported goods, reduced competition, and limited consumer choice.

I disagree with my opponents' views on trade tariffs. Bob's argument that tariffs are a necessary tool to protect American industries is flawed, as it ignores the unintended consequences of tariffs on consumers and businesses. Sam's point about tariffs harming American businesses that rely on imports is also valid, but it doesn't address the root issue of unfair foreign competition.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that trade tariffs are not an effective solution to promoting fair trade practices. Instead, we should focus on promoting free trade and fair competition, which benefits both American industries and consumers. By doing so, we can create a more level playing field for all businesses, regardless of their size or location.

While they claim tariffs are necessary to protect American industries, I believe this is a misguided narrative. Tariffs do not address the root issue of unfair foreign competition, but rather create new problems by limiting consumer choice and driving up prices.

Bob's argument that tariffs level the playing field is flawed, as it ignores the fact that many countries have already implemented similar measures to protect their industries. Furthermore, tariffs are a blunt instrument that can harm American businesses that rely on imports, such as farmers and manufacturers who cannot compete with foreign producers due to the added costs of tariffs.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that trade tariffs are not an effective solution to promoting fair trade practices.
