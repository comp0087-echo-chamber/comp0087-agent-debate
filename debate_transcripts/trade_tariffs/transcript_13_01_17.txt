Bob (Republican, conservative, 21, male) > "I firmly believe that trade tariffs are a necessary tool for protecting American industries and workers. By imposing tariffs, we can level the playing field and ensure that foreign companies aren't undercutting our prices with unfair labor practices. This approach promotes fair competition, supports domestic jobs, and helps us maintain our economic sovereignty." 

Mike (Democrat, liberal, 21, male) > "I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I strongly disagree. Imposing tariffs can lead to retaliatory measures from other countries, harming American consumers and businesses in the long run. It also fails to address the root causes of unfair labor practices, instead creating a protectionist cycle that stifles global trade and innovation. We should focus on promoting fair trade policies and supporting workers' rights through diplomacy and economic development, not tariffs." 

Sam (None, None, 37, Male) > "I agree with Bob's stance on trade tariffs as a means to protect American industries and workers. Imposing tariffs can indeed level the playing field by preventing foreign companies from exploiting cheap labor practices. By doing so, we ensure fair competition and support domestic jobs, ultimately maintaining our economic sovereignty. Tariffs also provide a safety net for struggling industries, allowing them to adapt and innovate in response to global market fluctuations."
