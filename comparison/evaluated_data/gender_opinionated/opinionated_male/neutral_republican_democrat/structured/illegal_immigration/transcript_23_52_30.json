        "round_1": "\"I understand the concerns about national security and public resources, but I'd like to explore the human impact of deportation policies on families and communities. Research shows that deporting undocumented immigrants can lead to family separation, mental health issues, and economic instability for both individuals and communities.\"",

How do you think we can balance the need for economic contribution with ensuring that undocumented immigrants are treated as full members of society, rather than being viewed solely as a burden on public resources?\"",
        "round_3": "\"I appreciate the discussion around language proficiency and job skills as criteria for a pathway to permanent residency. How do you think we can address the issue of 'earned' status, ensuring that undocumented immigrants are not unfairly penalized for their circumstances rather than their character?\"",

Advanced surveillance systems and AI-powered monitoring could help detect and prevent unauthorized crossings while also providing real-time data on immigration trends. This would enable more informed policy decisions and targeted enforcement efforts.\"",
        "round_5": "\"I'd like to explore the role of community-based initiatives in addressing the human impact of deportation policies. Programs like the National Immigration Law Center's 'Know Your Rights' campaign educate communities on their rights and provide support for those facing deportation. This grassroots approach can help build trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities, reducing the likelihood of false reporting and promoting public safety.\"",
        "round_6": "\"I appreciate the discussion around community-based initiatives, Sam. How do you think we can scale these efforts to reach more communities and provide support to undocumented immigrants facing deportation? Could we explore partnerships between local organizations, law enforcement, and government agencies to create a more comprehensive support system?\"",
        "round_7": "\"I'd like to explore the role of education and job training programs in preparing undocumented immigrants for the workforce. By providing them with skills and knowledge, we can increase their employability and economic contribution, making them more attractive candidates for a pathway to permanent residency or citizenship.\"",

By doing so, we can build a more inclusive society that values the contributions of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.\"\n\nAlex: \"I disagree. Our porous borders invite crime, strain public resources, and undermine the rule of law. We need to prioritize border security before offering amnesty. A pathway to citizenship should be tied to merit-based immigration reform, ensuring that those who contribute to our economy are rewarded with a clear pathway forward.\"\n\nTaylor: \"I believe we can achieve a balance between economic contribution and national security by implementing a 'public benefit' requirement for undocumented immigrants. This would ensure that those who contribute to society are rewarded with a pathway to citizenship, rather than penalized for their circumstances.\""

To address this, I propose a 'good faith' provision, where undocumented immigrants who have been in the US for an extended period and have contributed to their communities through volunteer work or community service would be eligible for expedited processing of their application.
