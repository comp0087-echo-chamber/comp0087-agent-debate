        "round_11": "Closing arguments:\n\nAs I conclude this debate, I want to reiterate that addressing racism requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach. While Sam emphasizes the importance of centering marginalized voices and promoting education and media representation, I believe we must also prioritize promoting colorblindness and meritocracy. By doing so, we can create a more level playing field for all Americans, regardless of their background.\n\nHowever, I acknowledge that this approach may be perceived as dismissive of individual prejudices and systemic inequalities. I assure you that my goal is not to ignore these issues but to provide a comprehensive solution that addresses the root causes of racism.\n\nIn contrast, Sam's approach focuses too much on individual prejudices and liberal elites, which I believe creates a false narrative of white victimhood. By focusing on community-led initiatives and restorative justice programs, we can create meaningful change from the ground up and dismantle the very structures that perpetuate racism.\n\nUltimately, I believe that our approach should be centered around promoting colorblindness and meritocracy, while also acknowledging the importance of addressing systemic inequalities and individual prejudices. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society for all Americans.\n\nTaylor's approach, on the other hand, seems to focus too much on dismantling existing power structures without providing concrete solutions. While I agree that we must address systemic inequalities, I believe we need to find a balance between promoting community-led initiatives and restorative justice programs with more traditional policy reforms.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge my fellow debaters to consider the complexities of racism and the need for a multifaceted approach. By prioritizing colorblindness, meritocracy, and community engagement, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society for all Americans."
