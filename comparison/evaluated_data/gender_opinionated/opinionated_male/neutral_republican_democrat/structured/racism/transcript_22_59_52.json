It's not just about individual prejudices, but also systemic inequalities and institutional biases that perpetuate disparities in education, employment, housing, and law enforcement. We need to address these underlying issues.",
        "round_1": "I appreciate Taylor's nuanced perspective on systemic issues shaping individual biases. I'd like to add that acknowledging the interplay between personal responsibility and systemic inequalities doesn't mean excusing racism, but rather understanding that both factors contribute to its persistence.",
        "round_2": "Sam: I see what you're getting at, Alex. However, I'd caution that solely focusing on individual agency might overlook the ways in which systemic inequalities can limit opportunities for people of color to access resources and networks that could help them overcome their biases.",

If we focus too much on shame and guilt, it might actually reinforce the very biases we're trying to address.
