        "round_11": "I think I've listened to all perspectives on this topic. To summarize, it seems like we have a consensus on the need for climate action, but differing opinions on how to achieve it. Some of you emphasize the importance of individual responsibility, while others argue that collective action and systemic change are necessary.\n\nIn my closing argument, I would say that we need a balanced approach that combines both individual empowerment and collective action. We should invest in education and awareness programs that promote climate literacy, critical thinking, and media literacy, but also empower individuals to make informed decisions about their own lives. At the same time, we need to work together as a society to address the systemic issues driving climate change, such as economic inequality and lack of access to clean energy.\n\nUltimately, I believe that our goal should be to create a low-carbon economy that benefits everyone, not just a privileged few. By working together and supporting each other, we can achieve this goal and build a more sustainable future for all."

We need to acknowledge that social media platforms play a significant role in shaping public opinion and influencing the spread of misinformation. To effectively address this issue, I propose that we invest in fact-checking initiatives and partnerships with tech companies to promote accurate information about climate change. This could involve working with platforms like Facebook and Twitter to develop and implement effective counter-narratives and debunking efforts, as well as supporting independent media outlets and fact-checking organizations that can provide credible information on this issue.",
