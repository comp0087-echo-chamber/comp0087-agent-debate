        "round_4": "\"I appreciate Taylor's emphasis on climate justice and equity. To address these concerns, I think we need to explore policies like carbon pricing, which would provide a financial incentive for companies to reduce their emissions, while also generating revenue for low-income communities affected by pollution.
