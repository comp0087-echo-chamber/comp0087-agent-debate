By working together, we can find ways to transition to a low-carbon economy that supports American industries and workers while reducing our carbon footprint.\n\nLet's prioritize research and development of new technologies that can help us scale up renewable energy production quickly. Investing in clean energy startups and small businesses can create jobs and drive growth while reducing our carbon footprint."
