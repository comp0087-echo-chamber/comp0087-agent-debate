        "round_0": "\"I believe we need to focus on securing our borders, not demonizing those who are here without documentation. Many undocumented immigrants are hardworking individuals who contribute to our economy and communities. We should prioritize a path to citizenship for those who meet certain criteria.\"",
        "round_1": "\"I see my colleagues' points, but what about the economic benefits of a well-integrated immigrant population? Studies show that immigrants start new businesses, create jobs, and pay taxes \u2013 all while contributing to our cultural diversity. By offering a path to citizenship, we can harness their skills and talents.\"",
        "round_2": "\"I agree with Emily's point about leveling the playing field. To address Sarah's concern about fairness and consistency, I propose a merit-based system that rewards individuals who have contributed positively to our society through education, work experience, or community service. This approach would ensure that those who truly deserve citizenship are given a chance.\"",
        "round_3": "\"I agree with Emily that our approach should prioritize inclusivity and equity. To address Sarah's concerns about fairness, I propose establishing an independent review board to ensure that our criteria for 'positive contributions' are transparent, unbiased, and based on evidence.

        "round_5": "\"I'd like to add that a well-designed merit-based system should prioritize skills over language proficiency or work experience. This would allow highly skilled individuals to contribute their expertise to the economy, regardless of their immigration status. By focusing on skills rather than background, we can attract top talent and drive innovation.\"",
        "round_6": "\"I'd like to add that a well-designed merit-based system should also prioritize family reunification as a key criterion. This would allow families who are already contributing members of our society to be reunited with their loved ones, rather than being forced to wait years or even decades for a chance at citizenship. By prioritizing family reunification, we can promote unity and stability within our communities.\"",
        "round_7": "\"I agree with Emily's point about education and vocational training. To address Sarah's concern about protecting American workers' rights, I propose a 'pathway to permanent residency' for undocumented immigrants who meet certain criteria, such as having worked in the US for a set number of years or contributing significantly to their community through volunteer work or entrepreneurship. This would allow them to access better-paying jobs and benefits while also ensuring that American workers are protected.\"",

While I understand the appeal of a merit-based system, it's crucial to prioritize national security concerns and protect American jobs and wages. We can't compromise on these essential issues. Instead, let's focus on securing our borders and enforcing existing immigration laws before we start rewarding lawbreakers with a free ticket to citizenship.\"\n\nEmily: \"I agree that border security is crucial, but we mustn't forget the human cost of strict enforcement.
