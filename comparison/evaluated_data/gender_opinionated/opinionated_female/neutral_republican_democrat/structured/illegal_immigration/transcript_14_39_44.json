        "round_1": "\"I agree with Emily that we need to consider the human aspect of this issue. However, I'd like to propose a middle ground: instead of granting blanket amnesty, let's focus on creating a merit-based system for those who are already contributing to our economy and communities. This way, we can reward hard work while maintaining border security.\"",
        "round_2": "\"I see where Sarah is coming from about the slippery slope, but I think a merit-based system can help mitigate that risk.

        "round_3": "Sam: \"I think Emily's idea of a pilot program is a great starting point.

This would not only benefit the individuals but also contribute to the overall economic growth.\"",
        "round_4": "\"I think we're getting closer to finding common ground. Let's consider a compromise: implement E-Verify nationwide, increase border patrol personnel, and invest in physical barriers while also establishing a pilot program with language training and vocational assessments.

        "round_5": "\"I agree with Emily's point about reducing the incentive for people to cross our borders. However, I'd like to add that a pathway to citizenship would also help address the humanitarian crisis at our borders.

        "round_6": "\"I think Emily's point about increasing trust in our government is well-taken. To address Sarah's concerns about vetting and oversight, I propose that we establish a bipartisan commission to review and recommend reforms to the naturalization process.
