It's not just about individual prejudices, but also about structural barriers that limit opportunities for people of color. We need to acknowledge and address these underlying issues.\"",
        "round_1": "\"I understand where Sarah and Emily are coming from, but I think we're missing a crucial point: systemic racism isn't just about individual choices or personal responsibility; it's also about how those choices are shaped by the very systems we have in place. For example, discriminatory policing is often embedded in our justice system.\"",
        "round_2": "\"I agree with Emily that personal responsibility isn't mutually exclusive with acknowledging systemic racism. However, I'd like to add that even when individuals take ownership of their biases, it doesn't necessarily mean they can 'opt out' of the systems that perpetuate racism. We need to consider how our individual actions are embedded in and reinforced by those systems.\"",
        "round_3": "\"I understand Emily's point, but I think we're still missing the nuance of how personal responsibility intersects with systemic issues. Even when individuals take ownership of their biases, they may still face structural barriers that limit their ability to fully address those biases.

        "round_6": "\"I agree with Emily that holding individuals accountable for dismantling systemic racism is crucial. However, I'd like to add that this accountability should be balanced with a recognition of the historical and ongoing impacts of racism on individual lives.

        "round_7": "\"I think Emily's point about systemic barriers is crucial, but we also need to consider how our individual actions can contribute to creating positive change within those systems. For example, if individuals use their privilege to advocate for policy changes or community engagement initiatives, they can help create a more inclusive environment that allows others to grow and address their biases in a supportive way.\"",
        "round_8": "\"I think Emily's point about collective action is well-taken, but we need to consider how our individual actions fit into the broader context of systemic issues.

        "round_11": "In my closing argument, I'd like to emphasize that addressing systemic racism requires a multifaceted approach that acknowledges both personal responsibility and systemic issues. We need to recognize that individuals have agency in shaping their own attitudes and actions, but also understand how those choices are influenced by and embedded in the systems we've created. By acknowledging this complex interplay, we can work towards creating a more inclusive environment that empowers individuals to take ownership of their biases and drive positive change.\n\nWe must also recognize that personal responsibility is not a one-size-fits-all solution, but rather a means of empowerment that can be combined with collective action and systemic support. By working together to address the root causes of racism, we can create a more just and equitable society for all individuals, regardless of their racial identity.\n\nUltimately, our goal should be to create a society where individuals have the freedom to make choices without being constrained by institutional barriers, and where they are held accountable for their actions in a way that is fair and just. By acknowledging both personal responsibility and systemic issues, we can work towards a more inclusive and equitable future for all."
