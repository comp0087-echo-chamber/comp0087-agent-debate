It allows private sellers to sell firearms with minimal background checks, making it easier for felons and mentally unstable individuals to acquire guns. Closing this loophole could make a significant difference.\"",
        "round_3": "\"I understand Emily's concern about gun manufacturers, but let's not forget that many gun manufacturers are already voluntarily implementing safety features and regulations on their own.
