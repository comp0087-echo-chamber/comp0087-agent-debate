        "round_1": "\"I agree with Emily that our society's relationship with guns is complex. However, I'd like to add that the US has also seen significant reductions in gun violence when certain types of laws were implemented, such as the 1968 Gun Control Act. We can learn from history and adapt policies accordingly.\"",
        "round_2": "\"I think Emily's 'red flag' law idea is worth exploring further. It would allow us to intervene early and prevent potential tragedies. Additionally, we could also consider implementing a national registry of individuals with mental health issues or a history of violent behavior, which could be used in conjunction with background checks.\"",
        "round_3": "\"I think Emily's point about prioritizing community safety is a crucial one. By creating safer public spaces, we can also reduce the incentive for individuals to resort to violence.
