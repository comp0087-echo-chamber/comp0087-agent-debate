        "round_1": "\"Taylor makes a valid point about the scientific consensus, but I'd argue we're not just debating the science \u2013 we're discussing our moral obligation to act. The consequences of inaction will be devastating for future generations. We have a responsibility to prioritize the planet's well-being over short-term economic gains.\"",
        "round_2": "\"Alex, I understand your desire for practical solutions, but we can't afford to wait for 'concrete policies' that might not be implemented until it's too late.
