We must take immediate action to reduce emissions and transition to renewable energy sources, prioritizing sustainability over short-term gains.\"\n\nTaylor: \"I agree with Sam that we need to act now, but I'd like to add that our approach should be guided by a commitment to justice and equity. We can't afford to leave vulnerable communities behind as we transition to a low-carbon economy. A just transition requires prioritizing their needs and ensuring that the benefits of renewable energy are shared fairly.\"\n\nAlex: \"I still have concerns about the urgency of the issue, but I acknowledge that human-caused climate change is real and happening now. I propose that we focus on evidence-based solutions, such as incentivizing innovation in clean energy and developing technologies that can adapt to changing climate conditions.\""
