This is not a natural fluctuation, but a deliberate change caused by our actions.\"",
        "round_3": "\"Alex, I understand your skepticism about correlation vs causation, but the evidence from multiple lines of research is overwhelming. The fact that CO2 levels have increased by 40% in just over a century, coinciding with the Industrial Revolution and widespread fossil fuel use, strongly suggests human activities are driving climate change.\"",
