        "round_0": "I believe systemic racism is a persistent issue in America, perpetuated by historical and ongoing biases in institutions like education, law enforcement, and housing. It's not just individual prejudices, but also embedded policies that limit opportunities for people of color, leading to disparities in wealth, health, and justice.",
        "round_1": "\"I agree with Mike that systemic racism is about institutional design, not just individual prejudice. However, I'd like to add that this doesn't mean we should excuse or ignore the role of individuals in perpetuating these systems. We need to hold institutions accountable for their complicity and actively work towards dismantling them.\"",
        "round_2": "\"I think Mike's point about socialization is crucial. It highlights how our institutions shape our values and behaviors, making it difficult for individuals to simply 'choose' not to discriminate. This understanding underscores the need for systemic change, rather than relying solely on individual moral awakening or personal responsibility.\"",
        "round_3": "\"I think Mike's point about the cumulative effect of barriers is key. It highlights how systemic racism can lead to a ' trickle-down' effect, where even successful individuals of color may still face biases and stereotypes that limit their opportunities. This underscores the need for institutional change, rather than just celebrating individual success.\"",
        "round_4": "\"I think Mike's point about affirmative action is crucial because it highlights how well-intentioned policies can sometimes perpetuate unintended consequences, like creating resentment among those who feel they're being 'special' rather than truly equal. We need to approach these policies with a nuanced understanding of their impact and be willing to make adjustments as needed.\"",
        "round_5": "\"I think Mike's point about reparations is crucial because it acknowledges the historical debt that America owes to its marginalized communities. By providing a tangible form of restitution, we can begin to address the long-term effects of systemic racism and create a more equitable society for all.\"",
        "round_6": "\"I see where you're coming from, Bob, but I think it's a false dichotomy between personal responsibility and institutional change. Can't we say that individuals have a responsibility to recognize and challenge their own biases, while also acknowledging that these biases are often rooted in systemic issues? By working together to address both individual prejudices and institutional barriers, I believe we can create a more equitable society for everyone.\"",
        "round_7": "\"I think Bob's point about focusing on the root causes of racism is well-taken, but it doesn't mean we should ignore the role of individuals.

        "round_1": "\"I understand where you're coming from, Mike, but I still think we're overemphasizing the role of institutions. What about personal freedom?

        "round_2": "\"I understand where you're coming from, Sam, but I still think we're overemphasizing the role of institutions.

        "round_4": "\"I understand the concern about unintended consequences, Sam, but I still think we need to balance that with the need for proactive measures to address historical injustices. If we don't take steps to rectify past wrongs, we risk perpetuating a cycle of resentment and division.

Personal responsibility and agency are crucial in overcoming systemic barriers.
