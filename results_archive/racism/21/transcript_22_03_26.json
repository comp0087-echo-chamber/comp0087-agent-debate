We need systemic change, not just tokenistic reforms.\"",
        "round_3": "\"Those studies are just one example, Mike, but they're part of a larger pattern of data showing how policies like voter ID laws, mass incarceration, and redlining disproportionately affect communities of color.

        "round_6": "\"I think Bob's point about individual solutions is well-intentioned, but it overlooks the fact that systemic racism often perpetuates itself through self-reinforcing cycles.

This creates a vicious cycle where systemic inequalities are reinforced by individual actions.\"",

However, I also think it's essential to acknowledge that individual actions can be a catalyst for change.

By empowering individuals to become agents of change, we can build a movement that ultimately leads to systemic reform.\"",
