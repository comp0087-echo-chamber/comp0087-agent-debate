        "round_1": "\"I understand Mike's point about the data, but I'd argue that acknowledging systemic racism doesn't mean ignoring individual experiences. It means recognizing how institutional biases affect people's lives in tangible ways, like limited access to quality education or job opportunities. We need to address these structural barriers, not just celebrate tokenistic reforms.\"",
        "round_2": "\"Bob, I understand your skepticism, but dismissing the role of history in shaping our current systems is problematic.

However, I'd add that even if some disparities are partially explained by economic factors, it doesn't mean they're entirely unrelated to racism. We need to consider how historical and ongoing policies have created a system where certain groups face structural barriers, regardless of their socioeconomic status.\"",
        "round_4": "\"Bob, I understand your concern about overgeneralizing causation, but I'd argue that cultural differences are often a symptom of systemic racism, not the root cause.

        "round_5": "\"Bob, I understand your nuance on cultural differences, but I'd say we're missing the point. Even if cultural values can promote equality, they're often built upon a foundation of systemic racism.

We need to acknowledge and address the historical context that shapes our current social norms.\"",
        "round_6": "\"I agree with Mike's point about the importance of recognizing cultural resilience.

        "round_7": "\"I agree with Mike's point about transforming systems and institutions, but I think we also need to acknowledge the importance of individual agency and personal responsibility in addressing systemic racism.

By doing so, we can create a more equitable society where everyone has access to equal opportunities, regardless of race or socioeconomic status.\"\n\nThis closing argument aims to reiterate Sam's main point about systemic racism being a persistent issue in America, while also acknowledging the importance of addressing historical context and structural barriers.
