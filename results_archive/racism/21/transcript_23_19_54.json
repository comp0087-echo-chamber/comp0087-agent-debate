        "round_0": "I believe systemic racism is a persistent issue in America, perpetuated by historical and ongoing biases in institutions like education, law enforcement, and housing. It's not just individual prejudices, but also embedded policies that limit opportunities for people of color, creating a cycle of inequality.",
        "round_1": "\"I agree with Mike that policies like voter ID laws, mass incarceration, and redlining have a disproportionate impact on communities of color. However, I'd argue that these policies are often justified by flawed assumptions about people of color, perpetuating stereotypes and biases embedded in our institutions.\"",
        "round_2": "\"I think Bob and Mike are right that personal responsibility is important, but it's not a replacement for addressing systemic issues. We can't just expect individuals to overcome centuries of institutionalized racism without acknowledging the role of those systems in perpetuating biases. It's like trying to fix a leaky faucet with just Band-Aids.\"",
        "round_3": "\"I think Mike's point about amplifying individual actions through collective efforts is crucial. However, I'd add that this doesn't mean we should ignore the role of institutions in perpetuating biases. Instead, we need to work towards creating a culture where individuals feel empowered to challenge and change these systems from within.\"",
        "round_4": "\"I agree that grassroots efforts can inform policy changes, Mike. However, I'd argue that we need to be cautious not to co-opt or water down the very movements that are pushing for systemic change. We don't want to create a situation where institutions are merely paying lip service to diversity and inclusion without making meaningful structural adjustments.\"",
        "round_5": "\"I think Mike's point about critically evaluating institutional progress is crucial. However, I'd add that we also need to acknowledge the complexities of measuring systemic change. It's not just about numbers or metrics; it's also about listening to the experiences and perspectives of communities of color themselves. We need to center their voices in our efforts to create meaningful reform.\"",
        "round_6": "\"I think Mike's point about considering context is crucial. However, I'd add that we also need to acknowledge the role of power dynamics in shaping institutional responses to systemic racism. Who gets to decide what 'tough decisions' are being made, and whose voices are being centered in those conversations? We can't just assume that institutions are acting in good faith without critically examining their power structures.\"",
        "round_7": "\"I think Mike's point about creating an environment for individual leaders is crucial, but we also need to acknowledge that this approach can be exclusionary if it only benefits those who are already in positions of power. We need to ensure that our efforts to empower individuals are not just a Band-Aid solution, but rather a fundamental shift in how institutions operate and prioritize equity.\"",
        "round_8": "\"I think Mike's point about grounding transformation in a deep understanding of systemic racism is crucial, but we also need to acknowledge the importance of intersectionality in this process. We can't just address racism without considering how it intersects with other forms of oppression, such as sexism, homophobia, and ableism. This requires a more holistic approach that centers the experiences and perspectives of marginalized communities.\"",
        "round_9": "\"I think Mike's point about tailoring our approach to individual needs is crucial. However, I'd add that we also need to be mindful of how our efforts to support individuals may inadvertently reinforce existing power dynamics. For example, if we're providing resources or opportunities primarily for those who are already in positions of privilege, it can perpetuate the very systems of oppression we're trying to dismantle.\"",
        "round_10": "\"I think Mike's point about fundamentally transforming how institutions operate is crucial, but we also need to acknowledge the importance of creating a culture of accountability within those institutions. This means holding leaders and individuals accountable for their actions and biases, while also providing opportunities for growth and education.
