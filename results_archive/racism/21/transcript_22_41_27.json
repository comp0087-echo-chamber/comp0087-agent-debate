        "round_0": "I believe systemic racism is a persistent issue in America, perpetuated by historical and ongoing biases in institutions like education, law enforcement, and housing. It's not just individual prejudices, but also embedded policies that limit opportunities for people of color, hindering social mobility and equality.",
        "round_1": "\"I agree with Mike that we can't ignore these systemic issues. However, I'd argue that even if institutions are actively working to address biases, the legacy of those historical injustices still lingers. It's like trying to fix a house built on shaky foundations \u2013 you need to address the underlying structure.\"",
        "round_2": "\"I think we're getting closer to understanding the complexity of this issue. What I'd like to highlight is that even with well-intentioned policies, there's a need for ongoing accountability and transparency. We can't just rely on institutions' self-reported progress; we need concrete data and regular evaluations to ensure they're truly addressing systemic racism.\"",
        "round_3": "\"I understand Mike's point about the need for consistent enforcement of policies like affirmative action. However, I'd argue that even if the government can't regulate every institution perfectly, we still need to hold them accountable through legislation and public pressure. This can help create a culture of transparency and accountability, rather than relying solely on individual institutions' good intentions.\"",
        "round_4": "\"I think Mike's point about prioritizing long-term benefits is well-taken. However, I'd add that we also need to consider the role of education in perpetuating systemic racism. By not adequately addressing these issues in our educational institutions, we're essentially passing on a legacy of inequality to future generations.\"",
        "round_5": "\"I think Mike's point about structural barriers is crucial in understanding how systemic racism operates. However, I'd add that even with these limitations, individuals can still make choices that challenge or perpetuate biases. For example, a parent who recognizes the value of education for their child may actively seek out resources and opportunities to provide a better life, despite the systemic obstacles.\"",
        "round_6": "\"I think Mike's point about the reliance on institutional resources is a crucial one. However, I'd argue that even if these resources are limited, we can't afford to dismiss the potential for collective action and community-led initiatives to drive change. By working together across institutions and sectors, we can create a groundswell of support for systemic reforms that benefit marginalized communities.\"",
        "round_7": "\"I think Mike's point about dismantling structural barriers is crucial, but I'd add that even if we address these issues, there will still be pockets of resistance and bias within institutions. We need to acknowledge that change is often slow and imperfect, and that it requires ongoing effort and commitment from individuals and institutions alike.\"",
        "round_8": "\"I think Mike's point about the interplay between individual agency and systemic change is well-taken. However, I'd argue that even if individuals are empowered to make changes in themselves, they still need a supportive environment to do so. This means institutions and policymakers must prioritize creating policies and practices that foster inclusivity, equity, and social mobility \u2013 not just tolerate or accommodate diversity.\"",

        "round_10": "\"I think Mike's point about tangible actions and policy changes is crucial.

We need to acknowledge the historical and ongoing biases embedded in our institutions, and work towards creating policies and practices that promote inclusivity, equity, and social mobility. This means addressing structural barriers, providing education and awareness-raising efforts, and implementing tangible actions and policy changes. By working together, we can create a more just society where everyone has equal opportunities to thrive.\"\n\nBob: \"I agree that systemic racism is a complex issue, but I believe that individual agency and personal responsibility are crucial in driving change. We need to empower individuals to confront their own biases and work towards self-reflection and growth. While institutions and policymakers have a role to play in addressing systemic racism, it's ultimately up to each of us to make a difference. By focusing on education, awareness-raising, and individual empowerment, we can create a culture where people feel motivated to challenge biases and work towards a more just society.\"\n\nMike: \"I think we're all missing the point that systemic racism is not just an issue for institutions or policymakers, but also for individuals and communities. We need to recognize the structural barriers that limit access to resources, opportunities, and information, and work together to dismantle these systems of oppression.

        "round_3": "\"I agree with Sam's point about holding institutions accountable, but I think we also need to consider the unintended consequences of overregulation.
