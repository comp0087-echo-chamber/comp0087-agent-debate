We need to critically examine how our institutions have adapted and evolved over time.\"",
        "round_4": "\"I agree with Mike that individual agency is not the sole determining factor, but we also can't ignore the role of privilege and structural barriers in perpetuating inequality. For example, even if someone from a marginalized group has equal access to education, they may still face biases in the classroom or from teachers who don't recognize their experiences. We need to consider how these microaggressions add up to create a system-wide issue.\"",

        "round_7": "\"I understand where Bob and Mike are coming from, but I think we're missing a crucial point: the cumulative effect of microaggressions and biases in everyday interactions can be just as damaging as overt acts of racism. These subtle forms of bias can perpetuate systemic racism even when individuals don't intend to be discriminatory.\"",
        "round_8": "\"I agree that addressing systemic racism requires a multifaceted approach, but I think we need to be careful not to oversimplify the issue by focusing solely on individual actions or policies.

We can't just focus on one aspect of systemic racism without considering its complex and multifaceted nature.\"",

It's not just a matter of individual prejudices or biases; it's a complex web of historical and ongoing inequalities that have real-world consequences for marginalized communities.

We must prioritize policy reforms, education and training programs, and community-led initiatives that address the root causes of systemic racism, rather than just treating symptoms.
