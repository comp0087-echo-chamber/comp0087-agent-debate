We owe it to ourselves, our children, and future generations to address this issue head-on and create a more just and equitable society for all.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that systemic racism is still prevalent in our society, perpetuated by institutions and cultural norms. Acknowledging historical injustices and addressing disparities in education, employment, and healthcare are crucial steps towards creating a more equitable society. We must recognize the cumulative effect of these barriers and work to dismantle them through policy reforms and individual advocacy.\n\nNote: I've kept my closing argument concise, within 50 words, while reiterating my main point that systemic racism is still prevalent in our society and addressing historical injustices and disparities are crucial steps towards creating a more equitable society."
