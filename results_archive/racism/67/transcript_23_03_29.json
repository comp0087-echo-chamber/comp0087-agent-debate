        "round_2": "\"I see what you're saying, Alex, but I think it's a false dichotomy between individual responsibility and systemic racism.

        "round_3": "\"I'd like to add that even if we acknowledge individual agency, it's not a zero-sum game where one person's success is solely at the expense of another.

        "round_4": "\"I see what you're saying about privilege, Taylor, but let's not forget that systemic racism is a unique and persistent issue for African Americans.

        "round_5": "\"I agree with Taylor's point about addressing systemic barriers, but I'd like to add that we also need to acknowledge the role of implicit bias and microaggressions in perpetuating racism. These subtle forms of prejudice can be just as damaging as overt institutional racism, and we need to address them in our conversations and interactions.\"",
        "round_6": "\"I think Taylor raises a crucial point about how our language and framing can perpetuate or mitigate racism.

        "round_8": "\"I think we're having a nuanced conversation about this complex issue. Alex, I understand your perspective on personal responsibility, but I'd like to ask: what if someone is born into a system where they have limited access to resources, education, and job opportunities? Can they truly be held responsible for their circumstances if the deck is stacked against them from birth?\"",

This helps us understand the complexity of the issue and informs our policy decisions.\"",
        "round_11": "I think I've made my closing arguments on this topic. In conclusion, while personal responsibility is an essential aspect of individual success, it cannot be the sole factor in overcoming systemic barriers perpetuated by racism. We need to acknowledge and address these structural issues through policy changes, education, and community engagement. By recognizing both individual agency and the complexities of systemic racism, we can work towards creating a more just and equitable society where everyone has access to equal opportunities, regardless of their background.\n\nI believe that this nuanced understanding is crucial in addressing the persistent disparities faced by African Americans and other marginalized communities. We must move beyond simplistic solutions that blame individuals for their circumstances and instead focus on dismantling the systems that perpetuate inequality. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.\n\nI hope this conversation has shed light on the complexities of systemic racism and the importance of acknowledging both individual agency and structural barriers. I believe that by working together, we can create a brighter future for all Americans, regardless of their background or identity."
