However, I'd like to add that even if some individuals have achieved success through hard work, the playing field is often uneven. For example, African American entrepreneurs are less likely to secure small business loans or access capital compared to their white counterparts.\"",
        "round_2": "\"I see what Alex is getting at, but I think we're missing the point. Even if successful individuals are held accountable for their own success, that doesn't mean they don't face unique challenges due to systemic racism.

        "round_6": "\"I think Alex is right that personal responsibility plays a role, but I'd like to add that it's not an either-or situation.
