        "round_2": "\"I understand where you're coming from, Alex, but I think we're underestimating the impact of systemic racism on marginalized communities.

Just as white people may not even realize they're benefiting from systemic racism, individuals from marginalized groups may not be aware of the biases that limit their opportunities. We can't assume personal responsibility when the system itself is stacked against them.\"",
