How can we balance the need for social change with the risk of creating a culture of dependency?\n2. What role do large corporations play in perpetuating systemic racism and inequality?\n3. How can we work towards dismantling systems and structures that perpetuate inequality?\n\nTo move forward, I'd like to explore some possible next steps:\n\n1. **Exploring corporate power and influence**: We could discuss ways to hold large corporations accountable for their role in perpetuating systemic racism and inequality.\n2. **Dismantling systems and structures**: We could examine strategies for dismantling the systems and structures that perpetuate inequality, such as policy changes or community-led initiatives.\n3. **Balancing social change with dependency concerns**: We could explore ways to balance the need for social change with concerns about creating a culture of dependency on government handouts.\n\nWhich direction would you like to take our conversation?",
