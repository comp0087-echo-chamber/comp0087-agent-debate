        "round_11": "I think we're getting close to a resolution here. In my closing arguments, I'd like to summarize why I believe systemic racism is still prevalent in our society.\n\nSystemic racism is not just an issue of individual prejudice or bias; it's a deeply ingrained problem that affects every aspect of our lives. From education and employment to healthcare and housing, the data is clear: people of color face significant disparities in outcomes that are shaped by structural barriers, not just personal choices or biases.\n\nWe can't ignore the fact that systemic racism has been embedded in our institutions and policies for centuries, perpetuating inequality and limiting opportunities for marginalized groups. We need to acknowledge these disparities and work towards dismantling them through policy changes, community engagement, and education.\n\nBy doing so, we can create a more equitable society where everyone has access to equal opportunities, resources, and support. It's not about coddling people into victimhood or perpetuating a culture of entitlement; it's about recognizing the systemic barriers that prevent marginalized groups from achieving their full potential.\n\nWe need to listen to and learn from the experiences of successful individuals of color who have overcome obstacles through their own efforts.
