        "round_1": "\"I agree with Mike that international comparisons are relevant, but let's not forget that cultural and historical contexts play a significant role in shaping our laws. What works in other countries may not be directly applicable to the US, where we have a unique gun culture and history of gun ownership.\"",
        "round_2": "\"I understand Bob's concern about individual freedom, but we can't ignore the fact that lax background checks and loopholes in current laws allow guns to fall into the wrong hands. Closing these gaps would significantly reduce gun violence without infringing on Second Amendment rights.\"",

        "round_5": "\"I'd like to add that the Second Amendment is not just about individual freedom, but also about collective responsibility.
