        "round_1": "\"I understand where Mike is coming from, but what about the 2nd Amendment? If we're going to restrict certain types of guns or licenses, how do we draw the line?

        "round_6": "\"I'd like to propose a compromise: let's establish a national registry for individuals who have been involuntarily committed to mental institutions or have a history of violent behavior.
