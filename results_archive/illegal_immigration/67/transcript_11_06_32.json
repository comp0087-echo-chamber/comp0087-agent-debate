        "round_1": "\"I agree with Taylor that a pathway to citizenship can stimulate local economies.

        "round_3": "\"I understand Alex's concern about national security, but I'd like to propose an alternative: instead of demonizing undocumented immigrants, let's focus on creating a merit-based visa system that rewards skilled workers who contribute to our economy. This approach would attract high-skilled talent while maintaining border security.\"",
        "round_4": "\"I agree with Taylor's point about leveling the playing field. However, we must also consider the potential impact on small businesses and local economies that rely heavily on undocumented workers.

        "round_6": "\"I think Alex's concern about long-term consequences is valid, but I'd like to propose an alternative: instead of focusing on assimilation or contributions, let's focus on creating a pathway that encourages undocumented immigrants to become active members of their communities. This could include civic education programs, language classes, and volunteer opportunities that help them integrate into American society.\"",

However, I'd like to add that a pathway to citizenship can also help address the moral imperative of providing a safe haven for those fleeing persecution or violence in their home countries.

While I understand the moral imperative of providing a safe haven for those fleeing persecution or violence in their home countries, we can't compromise on this fundamental principle.

A pathway to citizenship is not just about economic benefits or national security concerns, but also about upholding the values of compassion, empathy, and inclusivity that are at the heart of American democracy.
