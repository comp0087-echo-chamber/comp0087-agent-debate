        "round_0": "\"I believe we need to focus on securing our borders, not demonizing those seeking a better life. Many undocumented immigrants are hardworking individuals who contribute to our economy and communities. We should prioritize humane solutions like pathways to citizenship and increased border security.\"",
        "round_1": "\"I agree with Taylor's point about compassion, but we also need to consider the economic impact of undocumented workers on our social safety net. If they're not contributing to the system through legal channels, it puts a strain on public services like healthcare and education. We need a balanced approach that addresses both security and humanitarian concerns.\"",
        "round_2": "\"I think we're missing the nuance of how many undocumented immigrants are already contributing to our tax base through payroll taxes, despite not paying income taxes. This revenue stream is often overlooked in the debate. By acknowledging this, we can have a more informed discussion about how to balance security and economic concerns.\"",
        "round_3": "\"I think we're getting closer to understanding the complexities of this issue. Let's not forget that many undocumented immigrants are also family members of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. By providing a pathway to citizenship, we can reunite families and create a more inclusive society where everyone has access to opportunities and resources.\"",
        "round_4": "\"I think we're at an impasse, but I'd like to propose a compromise: let's establish a clear pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who have been in the country for 10+ years, pay taxes, and pass background checks. This would allow them to contribute fully to society while also addressing concerns about border security and economic impact.\"",
        "round_5": "\"I agree with Taylor's caution about not excluding vulnerable populations. To address this concern, I propose we establish a separate track for refugees and asylum seekers, allowing them to apply for a pathway to citizenship or permanent residency through a streamlined process. This would ensure they receive the protection and support they need while also contributing to our society.\"",
        "round_6": "\"I think we're making progress by acknowledging the complexities of this issue. To further address concerns about economic impact, let's consider implementing a 'pathway to legalization' program that allows undocumented immigrants to pay a fine and back taxes in exchange for a clear path to citizenship. This would not only provide a sense of security but also generate revenue for our government.\"",
        "round_7": "\"I think Taylor's point about empowering undocumented immigrants through education and job training is crucial. By investing in their skills and knowledge, we can create a more inclusive economy where everyone has access to better-paying opportunities. Let's focus on providing them with the tools they need to succeed, rather than relying solely on punitive measures.\"",
        "round_8": "\"I think we're at a critical juncture where we need to balance competing priorities. While securing our borders is essential, it's equally important to acknowledge the humanity behind this issue. By providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who have been in the country for 10+ years, pay taxes, and pass background checks, we can create a more inclusive society that values diversity and promotes social cohesion.\"",
        "round_9": "\"I think Taylor's proposal for a civic integration program is a great idea. By providing undocumented immigrants with the tools they need to succeed in their new communities, we can create a more inclusive society where everyone has access to opportunities and resources. This approach would not only promote social cohesion but also help to build trust between law-abiding citizens and those seeking a better life.\"",
        "round_10": "\"I think we've made significant progress in our discussion today. I'd like to summarize our key points: securing our borders is crucial, but so is addressing the humanitarian concerns surrounding undocumented immigration. We need a balanced approach that prioritizes both security and compassion. By providing a pathway to citizenship for long-term residents who pay taxes and pass background checks, we can create a more inclusive society where everyone has access to opportunities and resources.\"",
        "round_11": "I'd like to add one final point: the importance of bipartisan cooperation in finding a solution. We need to put aside our differences and work together to address this complex issue. By engaging in respectful dialogue and listening to each other's perspectives, we can find common ground and create a more inclusive society for all.\n\nThis closing argument aims to:\n\n1. Summarize the key points discussed during the debate.\n2. Emphasize the importance of balancing competing priorities (security and compassion).\n3. Highlight the need for bipartisan cooperation in finding a solution.\n4. Encourage respectful dialogue and listening to each other's perspectives.\n\nBy using this approach, Sam aims to leave a positive impression on his fellow agents and contribute to a more constructive discussion about illegal immigration."

Pathways to citizenship only incentivize more people to break the law, undermining our system of immigration and national identity.\"",
        "round_1": "\"I understand the concern for compassion, but we can't forget that many undocumented immigrants are taking jobs from American citizens, driving down wages and stifling economic growth.

However, it's essential to note that many undocumented immigrants are not paying payroll taxes because they're not working in the formal economy.

        "round_3": "\"I understand Sam's point about family reunification, but we can't ignore the fact that many undocumented immigrants are also taking advantage of our social safety net without contributing to it.

A compromise on a pathway to citizenship for long-term residents is a step in the right direction, but it doesn't solve the problem of people entering our country without going through the proper channels. We should also consider implementing a merit-based immigration system that prioritizes skilled workers and entrepreneurs who can contribute to our economy.\"",
