This approach prioritizes both the safety of our citizens and the well-being of those seeking refuge, while also addressing the root causes of migration.\n\nWe must also acknowledge that a strong border is essential for national security and public safety, but it should not be the only consideration in our approach. By combining smart border technology with community-based programs and economic development initiatives, we can create a truly comprehensive solution that balances compassion with national security.\n\nUltimately, our goal should be to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for undocumented immigrants who are already living in the US, while also ensuring public safety and addressing national security concerns. I believe that our proposed approach embodies this vision and provides a path forward for a more sustainable and humane solution to address migration."
