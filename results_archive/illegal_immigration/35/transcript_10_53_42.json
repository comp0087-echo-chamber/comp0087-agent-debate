        "round_1": "\"I agree with Taylor that the human cost of deportation policies shouldn't be ignored. However, I'd like to add that a more effective approach might be to provide a clear pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who meet certain criteria, such as paying taxes, passing background checks, and demonstrating good character. This would incentivize them to come forward and integrate into society, rather than living in the shadows.\"",
        "round_2": "\"I think we're getting closer to finding a solution that balances compassion with national security. What if we combined the pathway to citizenship idea with a merit-based system, where undocumented immigrants who have skills in high demand are prioritized for residency? This would incentivize them to contribute to our economy while also ensuring public safety.\"",
        "round_3": "\"I agree with Taylor's point about the low recidivism rate among undocumented immigrants. However, I'd like to add that even if they're not a threat to public safety, their presence in our economy can still have unintended consequences, such as driving down wages for native-born workers or straining social services. A more nuanced approach would consider these economic impacts when evaluating immigration policies.\"",
        "round_4": "\"I'd like to build on Taylor's point about the economic contributions of undocumented immigrants. What if we also explored ways to incentivize businesses to hire and integrate undocumented immigrants into their workforce?

        "round_5": "\"I'd like to propose that we also consider the role of education and workforce development programs in integrating undocumented immigrants into our society. By providing vocational training, language classes, and other educational resources, we can help them acquire skills that are in demand by employers, making them more competitive in the job market and reducing their reliance on informal networks.\"",
        "round_6": "\"I think Taylor's point about community-based programs is a great way to build bridges between different communities. By investing in these types of initiatives, we can create a more inclusive society where undocumented immigrants feel valued and integrated into our economy and culture. This approach would also help address the root causes of migration by providing economic opportunities and social services in Central America.\"",
        "round_7": "\"I agree that technology can play a crucial role in identifying potential threats, but we shouldn't forget that many undocumented immigrants are law-abiding citizens who simply need a way to regularize their status. By investing in data analytics and other tools, we can also identify opportunities for integration and economic growth, rather than just focusing on enforcement.\"",
        "round_8": "\"I think Taylor's 'smart border' system is a promising approach that balances national security with compassion.

        "round_4": "\"I agree that incentivizing businesses to hire undocumented immigrants is a good idea, Sam.
