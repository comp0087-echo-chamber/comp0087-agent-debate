However, I'd like to add that we can't just focus on 'safe and legal pathways' without addressing the issue of undocumented immigrants who are already in our country.

This would allow them to contribute to society while also addressing the issue of undocumented immigration.\"",
        "round_3": "\"I'd like to propose a compromise: establish a 'Temporary Protected Status' (TPS) program for migrants fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries.
