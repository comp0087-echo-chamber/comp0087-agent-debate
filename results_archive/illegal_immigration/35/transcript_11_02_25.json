We cannot afford to prioritize compassion over national security, no matter how well-intentioned it may seem. A 'guest worker' program for low-skilled workers would provide a temporary solution to labor shortages while maintaining control over our borders. However, this should not be seen as a substitute for comprehensive reform that addresses the root causes of migration.\n\nWe need to take a firm stance on border security and enforcement, while also acknowledging the importance of providing a clear pathway for undocumented immigrants who have contributed to our economy and society. A merit-based system that prioritizes skilled workers and entrepreneurs would incentivize those who are already contributing to society to stay and integrate.\n\nUltimately, our goal should be to create a more secure and prosperous nation for all Americans, while also promoting economic growth and stability. I urge my colleagues to join me in advocating for a comprehensive approach that balances enforcement with compassion, and prioritizes the needs of American workers and citizens.\""
