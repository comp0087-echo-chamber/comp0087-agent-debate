        "round_11": "As I conclude this debate on illegal immigration, I want to reiterate that our nation's security and economic prosperity are at stake. We cannot afford to prioritize compassion over national interests. A strong economy starts with a secure one, and unregulated immigration will lead to increased competition for American workers, driving down wages and stifling entrepreneurship.\n\nWhile some may argue that providing a pathway to citizenship is economically beneficial, I firmly believe that it would only exacerbate the problem. We need to protect our citizens' jobs and ensure that any immigration reform prioritizes their interests. A fair and transparent system for employers to hire workers is essential, and a pathway to citizenship should be tied to employer verification and accountability.\n\nI understand the concerns about deportations and the impact on families, but we cannot sacrifice national security for the sake of compassion. We need to find a balance between being humane and being secure. I urge my fellow Americans to join me in supporting a comprehensive immigration reform that prioritizes our nation's interests while still showing compassion to those who are genuinely seeking a better life.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that our nation's security and economic prosperity should be our top priority when it comes to illegal immigration. We cannot afford to compromise on this issue, and I urge my fellow Americans to stand with me in supporting a strong and secure border."
