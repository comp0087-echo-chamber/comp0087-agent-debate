        "round_1": "\"I agree with Taylor's nuance, but let's not forget that many undocumented immigrants are fleeing violence, persecution, or natural disasters in their home countries. A compassionate approach shouldn't come at the expense of national security. We need to find a balance between protecting our borders and providing a safe haven for those fleeing harm.\"",
        "round_2": "\"I think we're missing the point of 'American jobs' and 'national security.' Many undocumented immigrants are filling labor gaps that American workers won't take, and they're not a threat to national security. In fact, many have served in our military or law enforcement. We need to recognize their contributions.\"",
        "round_3": "\"I think Taylor makes a compelling point about the economic benefits of integration. However, we also need to consider the human cost of not addressing the root causes of migration.

        "round_4": "\"I think we're at an impasse, but I'd like to propose a compromise: let's establish a clear pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who meet certain criteria, such as paying taxes, passing background checks, and demonstrating good character. This would incentivize them to come forward and integrate into our society, while also providing a sense of security and stability.\"",
        "round_5": "\"I agree that a robust border security system is crucial, but I think Alex's approach is too narrow-minded. We need to consider the complexities of modern migration and find solutions that balance enforcement with compassion and economic development.

        "round_6": "\"I think Alex's merit-based system is an interesting idea, but it raises concerns about who gets to decide what constitutes 'positive contributions' and how that will be enforced.

Alex, I understand your concerns about border security, but let's not forget that a strong economy and a stable society are also essential for national security.

Instead of relying solely on technology or border security measures, let's explore ways to integrate migrants into our society in a way that feels welcoming and inclusive. This could involve programs like language classes, job training, and cultural orientation, as well as increased funding for social services and community development initiatives. By taking a more holistic approach, we can create a system that not only secures our borders but also provides a safe haven for those fleeing harm or persecution.\""

By prioritizing contributions over nationality, we can attract talent while maintaining border security.\"",
        "round_6": "\"I agree with Sam's concern about fairness and transparency, but I think a merit-based system can be designed to address those concerns. For example, we could establish clear criteria for eligibility, such as language proficiency, education, and work experience, and ensure that the application process is accessible and free from bias.
