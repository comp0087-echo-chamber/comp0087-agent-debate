        "round_1": "\"I agree with Taylor that we have a moral obligation to help those fleeing persecution or violence. However, I also think we need to consider the economic benefits of immigration. Studies show that undocumented immigrants contribute significantly to our economy through taxes and entrepreneurship. We can't just exclude them without exploring alternative solutions.\"",
        "round_2": "\"I think we need to consider a more nuanced approach. Instead of solely focusing on enforcement or exclusion, what if we explored pathways for legalization and integration? This could include a merit-based visa system, allowing undocumented immigrants with skills and education to contribute to our economy while also providing a clear path to citizenship.\"",
        "round_3": "\"I think we're getting closer to finding common ground. What if we combined the idea of a merit-based visa system with increased funding for education and job training programs? This would allow undocumented immigrants to contribute to our economy while also investing in their own economic mobility and stability.\"",
        "round_4": "\"I'd like to add that a 'tech visa' program could also help address the issue of brain drain in the US. Many highly skilled undocumented immigrants are leaving the country due to lack of opportunities, so by providing them with a clear path to citizenship, we can retain their talent and expertise. This would not only boost our economy but also strengthen our national security.\"",
        "round_5": "\"I think we're on the right track by exploring alternative solutions. What if we also considered a 'green card lottery' system, where undocumented immigrants with strong ties to their home country can apply for a chance to immigrate?

What if we also explored the idea of creating a 'pathway to citizenship' for undocumented immigrants who have been living in the US for an extended period, such as 5-10 years, and have demonstrated good character and contributions to our society?
