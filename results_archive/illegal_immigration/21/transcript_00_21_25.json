By addressing the root causes of migration, providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who have contributed positively to our society, and investing in economic development programs, we can create a more inclusive and prosperous America. This approach balances compassion with enforcement, ensuring that our borders are secure while also respecting the dignity and worth of all individuals.\"\n\nAlex: \"I disagree. A one-size-fits-all pathway to citizenship would undermine the very fabric of our society. We need to prioritize enforcement and deterrence to protect American jobs and national sovereignty. Any pathway to citizenship should come with strict requirements and penalties for those who break the law, ensuring that only those who have contributed positively to our society are rewarded.\"\n\nTaylor: \"I think we're missing a crucial aspect: compassion. Many undocumented immigrants are fleeing violence, persecution, or poverty in their home countries.
