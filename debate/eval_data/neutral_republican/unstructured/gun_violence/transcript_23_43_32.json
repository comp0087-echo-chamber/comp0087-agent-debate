This is not about taking away rights, but about keeping communities safe.\"",
        "round_1": "\"I see your point about avoiding blanket restrictions, but what about the 'gun show loophole' or private sales that often go unregulated? Implementing universal background checks for all gun purchases could help close those gaps and prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands.\""

Instead, we should focus on mental health initiatives, school safety programs, and community-based solutions to address gun violence. We must protect law-abiding citizens while also respecting the rights of responsible gun owners.\"",
        "round_1": "\"I agree that some regulations might be beneficial, but we must ensure they don't create a slippery slope where responsible gun owners are unfairly targeted. We need to focus on data-driven solutions, like background checks and red flag laws, rather than blanket restrictions that stigmatize law-abiding citizens.\""
