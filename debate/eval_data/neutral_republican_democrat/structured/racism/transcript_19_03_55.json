Systemic racism refers to the ways in which institutions and systems perpetuate racial inequality. This can include policies, practices, and attitudes that disproportionately affect certain racial or ethnic groups, often unintentionally but with lasting impacts.\n\nFor example, in education, systemic racism might manifest as:\n\n* Zero-tolerance policies that lead to disproportionate suspensions and expulsions of students of color\n* Lack of representation and diversity in curricula, textbooks, and educational materials\n* Inequitable funding for schools serving predominantly low-income or minority communities\n\nIn employment, systemic racism might look like:\n\n* Biased hiring practices that favor white candidates over people of color\n* Limited opportunities for career advancement and professional development for employees from underrepresented groups\n* Pay disparities that result in lower wages for workers of color compared to their white counterparts\n\nThese are just a few examples, but the point is that systemic racism can manifest in many different ways across various institutions and systems.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you have any personal experiences or observations about systemic racism that you'd like to share?"
