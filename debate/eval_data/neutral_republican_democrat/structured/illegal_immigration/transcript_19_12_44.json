At the same time, we must address the root causes of migration by investing in economic development programs in home countries.\n\nBy providing a clear pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who contribute to our economy, we can incentivize them to formalize their employment, pay taxes, and integrate into our communities more fully.
