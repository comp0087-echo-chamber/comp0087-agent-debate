        "round_0": "\"I believe we need to focus on securing our borders, not demonizing those who are here without documentation. Many undocumented immigrants are hardworking individuals who contribute to our economy and communities. We should prioritize a path to citizenship for those who want to integrate into society.\"",
        "round_1": "\"I agree with Mike that we need to consider the humanitarian aspect, but we can't ignore the economic impact either. Undocumented immigrants often fill labor gaps and pay taxes, yet they're denied access to social services and benefits. A pathway to citizenship would help them integrate while also boosting our economy.\"",
        "round_2": "\"Bob, I understand your concerns about national security, but we can't dismiss the fact that many undocumented immigrants are already here and contributing to our communities. A pathway to citizenship would allow them to pay taxes, access healthcare, and participate in the democratic process, making them less likely to be radicalized or involved in criminal activity.\"",
        "round_3": "\"I appreciate Mike's suggestion. Implementing a pathway to citizenship with strict requirements would help ensure that only those who are genuinely committed to integrating into society receive the benefits of citizenship. This approach would also demonstrate our commitment to fairness and due process, rather than simply punishing undocumented immigrants for being in the country without documentation.\"",
        "round_4": "\"I agree with Mike that we need to consider the long-term benefits of investing in an inclusive immigration system. However, I'd like to add that we also need to address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, violence, and persecution, by providing economic opportunities, diplomatic solutions, and humanitarian aid to countries of origin. This would help reduce the incentive for people to flee their homes and seek a better life in our country.\"",
        "round_5": "\"I think we're getting closer to finding common ground, Bob. Instead of focusing solely on border security, let's consider a 'pathway to regularization' that includes a clear process for undocumented immigrants to come forward, pay any outstanding taxes or fines, and meet certain requirements before being eligible for citizenship. This approach would help maintain control over our borders while also providing a sense of stability and belonging for those who are already here.\"",
        "round_6": "\"I think Mike's points-based system is a great idea, Bob. By prioritizing skills and education, we can ensure that new immigrants are contributing members of society from the start. This approach would also help us attract top talent in fields like tech and healthcare, which could have a significant impact on our economy.\"",
        "round_7": "\"I think we're making progress in finding common ground, Bob. Instead of focusing solely on border security, let's consider a 'pathway to regularization' that includes a clear process for undocumented immigrants to come forward, pay any outstanding taxes or fines, and meet certain requirements before being eligible for citizenship. This approach would help maintain control over our borders while also providing a sense of stability and belonging for those who are already here.\"",
        "round_8": "\"I think Mike's suggestion of a hybrid system is a great idea, Bob. By combining the benefits of a pathway to regularization with the merit-based approach, we can create a more inclusive and effective immigration system that attracts high-skilled workers while also providing a clear path to citizenship for those who are already here.\"",
        "round_9": "\"I think Mike's point about addressing the root causes is crucial, Bob. However, I'd like to add that we also need to consider the role of technology in streamlining the immigration process. Implementing digital solutions such as online portals for immigrants to apply for regularization, biometric data collection, and AI-powered screening could help reduce processing times and increase efficiency.\"",
        "round_10": "\"I think Mike's point about clear guidelines and support services is crucial, Bob. We need to ensure that new immigrants have access to the resources they need to succeed in our country. This could include vocational training programs, job placement services, and mental health support. By providing a comprehensive support system, we can help new immigrants build a stable life and contribute to our economy.\"",
        "round_11": "In my closing argument, I'd like to reiterate that a pathway to regularization with strict requirements is a crucial step towards creating a more inclusive and effective immigration system. By providing a clear process for undocumented immigrants to come forward, pay any outstanding taxes or fines, and meet certain requirements before being eligible for citizenship, we can ensure that only those who are genuinely committed to integrating into society receive the benefits of citizenship.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that our proposed hybrid system, which combines the benefits of a pathway to regularization with a merit-based approach, is a step in the right direction. By attracting high-skilled workers and entrepreneurs while also providing a clear path to citizenship for those who are already here, we can create a more inclusive and effective immigration system that benefits both our economy and our communities.\n\nI'd like to emphasize that this is not a silver bullet solution, but rather a comprehensive approach that addresses the complex issues surrounding immigration. By working together and finding common ground, I believe we can create a more just and equitable immigration system that reflects our values of compassion, inclusivity, and fairness."

However, I'd like to suggest that we also consider implementing a 'pathway to citizenship' for certain groups of undocumented immigrants, such as those who have been in the country for over 10 years or have children who are U.S.-born citizens.
