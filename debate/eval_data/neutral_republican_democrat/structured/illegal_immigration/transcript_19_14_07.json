This perpetuates a cycle of vulnerability and exploitation.\"",
        "round_4": "\"Bob, I understand your concern about national security, but what if our current approach is actually creating more vulnerabilities? Think about it: undocumented immigrants are often forced to rely on cash-based economies, which can be exploited by organized crime. By providing a clear path to legalization, we can actually reduce the appeal of these illicit activities and create a safer, more legitimate economy.\"",
        "round_5": "\"I agree that enforcement is crucial, but it's equally important to recognize that many undocumented immigrants are already here, contributing to our economy.

        "round_6": "\"I think Mike's point about reducing the appeal of illicit activities by providing a clear path to legalization is crucial.

We need to prioritize both enforcement and humane solutions. A pathway to citizenship would not only provide a clear and efficient process for legalization but also create a more sustainable solution by addressing the root causes of migration and providing opportunities for American workers.\n\nBy investing in education, job training, and infrastructure, we can reduce the \"pull\" factors that attract people to our borders and create more opportunities abroad. This approach would not only benefit undocumented immigrants but also contribute to a stronger economy and a more diverse, skilled, and innovative workforce.\n\nUltimately, it's time for us to move beyond the status quo and adopt a more comprehensive and compassionate approach to immigration reform. By working together, we can create a system that balances enforcement with compassion and opportunity for those seeking a better life."
