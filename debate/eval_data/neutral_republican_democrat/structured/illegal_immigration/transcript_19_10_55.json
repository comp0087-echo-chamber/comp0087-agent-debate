        "round_0": "\"I believe we need to focus on securing our borders, not demonizing immigrants. Many come here seeking a better life, contributing to our economy and culture. We should prioritize humane treatment, education, and job training programs to help them integrate, rather than relying solely on enforcement.\"",
        "round_1": "\"I understand the concerns about national security and economic impact, but we can't ignore the human cost of deportation. Many undocumented immigrants have built lives here, contributing to our communities. A more effective approach would be to provide a pathway to citizenship for those who meet certain criteria, allowing them to contribute fully to society.\"",
        "round_2": "\"I agree that our government's failure to address the root causes of migration is a significant issue. However, we can't wait for other countries to take action before we act ourselves. We should also consider the economic benefits of integrating undocumented immigrants into our workforce, such as filling labor gaps and stimulating local economies.\"",
        "round_3": "\"I think we're getting closer to finding common ground. Instead of a one-size-fits-all solution, what if we explored a tiered system? For those who are here illegally but have no criminal record or ties to organized crime, we could offer a pathway to citizenship with certain conditions, such as language proficiency and community service. This would allow them to contribute while also respecting the rule of law.\"",
        "round_4": "\"I agree that investing in technology and infrastructure is crucial, Mike. However, we also need to consider the human cost of delayed processing times. Many asylum seekers are forced to wait months or even years for their cases to be heard, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation and harm. A balanced approach would prioritize both border security and efficient processing.\"",
        "round_5": "\"I think Mike's point about incentivizing voluntary compliance is a crucial one. By offering a pathway to citizenship, we can create a sense of accountability and encourage undocumented immigrants to report their presence to authorities, reducing the need for enforcement actions that often lead to deportation.\"",
        "round_6": "\"I think Mike's point about tying the pathway to citizenship to specific economic and cultural contributions is a great way to address the magnet effect. We could also consider implementing a points-based system, where individuals are awarded points for their skills, education, and community involvement, and those with the most points are prioritized for consideration. This would help ensure that the pathway is targeted towards those who can make the most positive contributions to our society.\"",
        "round_7": "\"I think Bob's suggestion of exploring alternative solutions like guest worker programs or temporary work visas is a great idea. By providing a legal pathway for workers to enter the country, we can address labor gaps while also respecting the rule of law. This could also help reduce the incentive for people to come here illegally, as they would have a legitimate way to contribute to our economy.\"",
        "round_8": "\"I think Bob's point about prioritizing border security is valid, but what if we're not just talking about physical barriers? We need to consider the economic and social impact of our policies on American communities. A pathway to citizenship could actually increase border security by incentivizing undocumented immigrants to come forward voluntarily, rather than trying to sneak in.\"",
        "round_9": "\"I think we're getting close to finding a solution that balances enforcement with compassion. What if we also explored alternative solutions like guest worker programs or temporary work visas, which would allow us to address labor gaps while still maintaining border security? This could be a compromise that addresses both Sam's and Mike's concerns.\"",

        "round_11": "In my closing argument, I'd like to reiterate that a balanced approach is necessary to address the complex issues surrounding illegal immigration. We need to prioritize both border security and humane treatment of undocumented immigrants. By offering a pathway to citizenship for those who meet certain criteria, we can incentivize voluntary compliance, reduce the incentive for people to come here illegally, and create a sense of accountability among undocumented immigrants.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that our current system is too focused on enforcement and not enough on addressing the root causes of migration. We need to work with countries like Mexico and Central America to create stability and security, which would reduce the incentive for people to come here illegally.\n\nIn conclusion, I propose a tiered system that offers a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who meet certain criteria, such as language proficiency, community service, and economic contributions. This approach would allow us to balance enforcement with compassion, address labor gaps, and create a more inclusive and equitable immigration system."
