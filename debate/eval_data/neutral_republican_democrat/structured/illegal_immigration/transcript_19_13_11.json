        "round_0": "\"I believe we need to focus on securing our borders, not demonizing those who are here without documentation. Many undocumented immigrants are low-income workers who contribute to our economy and pay taxes. We should prioritize a path to citizenship for those who meet certain criteria.\"",
        "round_1": "\"I agree with Mike that compassion is essential, but it's also crucial to acknowledge the economic reality. Many undocumented immigrants are filling labor gaps that American workers won't take due to lack of skills or wages. By providing a path to citizenship, we can incentivize them to contribute more fully and fairly.\"",
        "round_2": "\"I understand Bob's concern about national sovereignty, but I'd argue that a well-managed immigration system is actually a strength, not a weakness. A pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who meet certain criteria would demonstrate our country's values of fairness, compassion, and opportunity.\"",
        "round_3": "\"I'd like to add that a well-managed immigration system also benefits our economy by filling labor gaps, increasing productivity, and stimulating innovation. By providing a pathway to citizenship, we can tap into the skills and talents of undocumented immigrants who are already contributing to our society, rather than driving them underground.\"",
        "round_4": "\"I'd like to propose a compromise: a temporary worker program that allows undocumented immigrants to work legally in exchange for a set period of time, during which they can apply for a pathway to citizenship. This would address labor gaps while also providing a clear path forward for those who are already contributing to our economy.\"",
        "round_5": "\"I agree with Mike's suggestion, but I'd like to add that we should also prioritize education and job training programs for undocumented immigrants who want to become citizens. This would help them acquire the skills needed to compete in the labor market and contribute even more fully to our economy.\"",
        "round_6": "\"I think Mike's suggestion about biometric tracking is a great idea, but we should also consider implementing a 'merit-based' system that prioritizes skilled workers and their families. This would ensure that those who contribute the most to our economy are given the opportunity to become citizens first, rather than just filling labor gaps.\"",
        "round_7": "\"I'd like to add that a pathway to citizenship would not only benefit undocumented immigrants but also their families and communities. By allowing them to become citizens, we're not just granting them a right, but also giving them the opportunity to fully participate in our society and contribute to the fabric of our communities.\"",
        "round_8": "\"I think Mike's suggestion about a clear timeline is a great idea, Bob. By providing a clear path forward and a sense of stability, we can encourage undocumented immigrants to integrate more fully into our society and contribute even more to the economy. This would also help to alleviate some of the uncertainty and fear that many are living with right now.\"",

        "round_10": "\"I'd like to propose an additional condition to strengthen Bob's concerns about border security: implementing a 'smart' border technology system that uses AI-powered sensors and drones to detect and track unauthorized crossings. This would provide real-time data on border activity, allowing us to respond quickly and effectively to any security breaches.\"",
        "round_11": "In conclusion, I firmly believe that a well-managed immigration system is essential for the prosperity and security of our nation. By providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who meet certain criteria, we can incentivize them to contribute more fully and fairly to our economy. This approach also acknowledges the economic reality and the human cost of not addressing this issue.\n\nI propose that we adopt a comprehensive immigration reform package that includes:\n\n1. A temporary worker program with biometric tracking and regular check-ins to ensure accountability.\n2. A merit-based system that prioritizes skilled workers and their families.\n3. Earned citizenship for undocumented immigrants who have been in the country for a certain number of years and have demonstrated good character.\n4. Increased funding for border patrol agents and infrastructure to support a smart border technology system.\n\nBy taking these steps, we can create a more compassionate and inclusive immigration system that balances fairness with accountability. We can provide a clear path forward for undocumented immigrants who meet certain criteria, while also maintaining our national sovereignty and protecting the rights of American citizens.\n\nI urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this comprehensive approach to immigration reform. Together, we can build a brighter future for all Americans, regardless of their immigration status."

We can't have a 'get out of jail free' card for undocumented immigrants without ensuring our borders are secure first.\"\n \nThis response builds on Sam's proposal by adding a condition that strengthens Bob's concerns about national sovereignty, while still acknowledging the need for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who meet certain criteria.",
