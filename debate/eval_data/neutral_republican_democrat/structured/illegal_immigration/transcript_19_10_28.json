        "round_0": "\"I believe we need to focus on securing our borders, not demonizing those who are here without documentation. Many undocumented immigrants are hardworking individuals who contribute to our economy and communities. We should prioritize a path to citizenship for those who meet certain criteria.\"",
        "round_1": "\"I agree with Mike's point about addressing the root cause of immigration. However, we also need to consider the economic benefits of undocumented immigrants who are already here. Studies have shown that they contribute significantly to our GDP through taxes and entrepreneurship. We can't just deport them without a plan for their integration.\"",
        "round_2": "\"I think Mike's point about the economic benefits of undocumented immigrants is crucial. We need to recognize that many of them are already paying taxes, contributing to Social Security and Medicare, and starting businesses that create jobs for Americans. By offering a path to citizenship, we can tap into their entrepreneurial spirit and create a more vibrant economy.\"",
        "round_3": "\"I think Mike's point about establishing clear criteria is key. If we provide a pathway to citizenship, we should also require undocumented immigrants to meet certain standards, such as passing a background check, paying any outstanding taxes or fines, and demonstrating proficiency in English and U.S. history. This would ensure that those who are granted citizenship have earned it through their contributions and commitment to our society.\"",
        "round_4": "\"I think we're getting closer to finding a solution that balances security with compassion. What if we also explored alternative solutions like regional compact programs, where states work together to address specific labor shortages and provide training programs for undocumented immigrants? This could help alleviate pressure on our resources while still allowing them to contribute.\"",
        "round_5": "\"I think we're missing the human aspect of this debate. We're talking about people's lives, families, and futures. What if we focused on creating a more inclusive society where everyone has access to education, job training, and economic opportunities? By doing so, we can reduce the need for undocumented immigration and create a more sustainable solution that benefits both our economy and our communities.\"",
        "round_6": "\"I think Mike's point about creating a more inclusive society is crucial. If we focus on addressing the root causes of immigration, such as poverty and lack of opportunity in sending countries, we can reduce the incentive for people to come to the US without documentation.

        "round_9": "\"I think Mike's point about a tiered system is a good starting point.

        "round_11": "In my closing argument, I want to reiterate the importance of finding a solution that balances security with compassion.

By doing so, we can address the issue of chain migration and ensure that those who are granted citizenship have earned it through their contributions.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge my fellow agents to join me in advocating for a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of immigration, provides a clear pathway to citizenship for those who have contributed to our society, and prioritizes skilled workers and entrepreneurs. By working together, we can create a more inclusive and prosperous society for all Americans."

        "round_0": "\"I disagree, Sam. Securing our borders is crucial, but it's not enough. We need to address the root cause of illegal immigration: porous borders and lax enforcement. A 'path to citizenship' would only incentivize more people to cross, putting a strain on our resources and social services.\"",
        "round_1": "\"I understand the concerns about humanitarian solutions, but we can't ignore the impact on American workers. Undocumented immigrants often take jobs from citizens, driving down wages and limiting opportunities. By prioritizing border security and enforcing our laws, we protect the rights of legitimate workers and ensure a level playing field.\"\n \n(I'll wait for your next response to proceed)",
        "round_2": "\"I understand the economic benefits argument, but what about the long-term consequences? If we grant amnesty to millions of undocumented immigrants, it sets a precedent for future generations to follow.

        "round_3": "\"I agree with Sam's point about establishing clear criteria for citizenship, but we also need to consider the issue of chain migration. If we grant amnesty to undocumented immigrants, they'll be able to sponsor family members from their home countries, leading to a surge in new arrivals and straining our resources even further.\"",
        "round_4": "\"I appreciate Sam's suggestion about regional compact programs. However, I'm concerned that such programs would create a patchwork of different rules and regulations across the country, leading to confusion and potential loopholes. We need a more comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of illegal immigration and ensures consistency in enforcement.\"",
        "round_5": "\"I understand Sam's emphasis on inclusivity, but we can't forget about national sovereignty. If we grant amnesty to millions of undocumented immigrants, it undermines the rule of law and erodes the very fabric of our country. We need to prioritize the rights and interests of American citizens over those of non-citizens.\"",
        "round_6": "\"I agree with Sam's point about addressing the root causes of immigration, but we also need to consider the issue of border security as a deterrent. If we don't secure our borders, we'll continue to attract people who are willing to take risks and disregard our laws. A strong border is essential to protecting American jobs and national sovereignty.\"",
        "round_7": "\"I understand Sam's point about addressing the root causes of immigration, but we need to be realistic about the complexity of this issue. Simply investing in economic development programs and education initiatives won't magically solve the problem overnight. We need a comprehensive approach that includes increased border security, enforcement of our laws, and a clear pathway to citizenship for those who meet certain criteria.\"",
        "round_8": "\"I agree that a comprehensive approach is necessary, but we need to be cautious about creating a 'one-size-fits-all' solution. We should consider implementing a tiered system of immigration reform, where those who are already here and have contributed to our society can earn a pathway to citizenship, while also addressing the root causes of migration in sending countries.\"",

        "round_10": "\"I think Sam's point about regional compact programs is a good starting point, but we need to ensure that any such program is carefully designed to prevent abuse and ensure accountability. We should also consider implementing a 'visa lottery' system for low-skilled workers, which would allow us to manage the flow of immigration more effectively.\"",
        "round_11": "In my closing argument, I want to reiterate the importance of prioritizing national sovereignty and the rule of law in addressing illegal immigration. While I agree that compassion and inclusivity are essential values, we cannot compromise on the fundamental principles of our country's identity and citizenship.\n\nA tiered system of immigration reform, which prioritizes those who have contributed to our society, is a step in the right direction. However, it must be accompanied by robust border security measures to prevent further influxes of undocumented immigrants. We need to ensure that any pathway to citizenship is earned through hard work, education, and contributions to our society, rather than simply being granted due to circumstance.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that we should focus on addressing the root causes of immigration, such as poverty and lack of opportunity in sending countries, rather than just treating the symptoms. By investing in economic development programs and education initiatives, we can create a more stable and secure environment for everyone.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge my fellow agents to join me in advocating for a comprehensive approach that prioritizes national sovereignty, addresses the root causes of immigration, and provides a clear pathway to citizenship for those who have earned it through their contributions.

        "round_2": "\"I understand Bob's concern about setting a precedent, but we've already done that with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The fact that many undocumented immigrants have been living in the US without documentation for years doesn't mean they're not deserving of a chance to contribute and integrate into society.

        "round_3": "\"I understand Bob's concern about chain migration, but research suggests that the vast majority of chain migrants are already U.S. citizens or have been living in the country for years, contributing to our economy and society.
