        "round_0": "\"I believe we need to focus on securing our borders, not demonizing those who are here without documentation. Many undocumented immigrants are simply trying to escape poverty and violence in their home countries. We should prioritize a path to citizenship for those who contribute positively to society.\"",
        "round_1": "\"I agree with Mike's point about demonizing undocumented immigrants being counterproductive. However, I'd like to add that a merit-based system for skilled workers could be a more effective solution than simply allowing anyone in. We need to ensure that those entering the country are contributing to our economy and society in meaningful ways.\"",
        "round_2": "\"I think we're getting closer to finding common ground. What if we implemented a 'guest worker' program, where undocumented immigrants can come to the US temporarily with a clear path to legalization after 3-5 years of work? This would allow us to address labor shortages while also providing a safety net for those fleeing poverty and violence.\"",
        "round_3": "\"I think we're making progress, but we need to consider the human cost of our policies. What if we implemented a 'pathway to citizenship' for undocumented immigrants who have been in the US for 5+ years, contributed to their communities, and paid taxes? This would provide a sense of security and stability for those who are already here.\"",
        "round_4": "\"I'd like to add that a pathway to citizenship should be tied to a comprehensive overhaul of our immigration system, including increased border security measures, improved vetting processes for employers, and enhanced protections for workers' rights.

        "round_1": "\"I understand where Mike and Sam are coming from, but we can't ignore the fact that many undocumented immigrants take jobs away from American citizens, particularly low-skilled workers.

This approach would also boost our economy by tapping into a skilled workforce.\"",
        "round_1": "\"I understand Bob's concern about job displacement, but research shows that undocumented immigrants often fill low-wage, high-demand jobs that Americans are reluctant to take due to lack of benefits or training.
