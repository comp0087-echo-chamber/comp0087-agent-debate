        "round_11": "In my closing argument, I'd like to reiterate that climate change is a pressing issue that requires immediate attention and collective action. We've discussed various concerns and counterarguments, but ultimately, the science is clear: human activities are causing global warming at an unprecedented rate.\n\nWhile Bob raises valid points about economic impact and complexity, I firmly believe that we can't afford to wait for \"common ground\" or \"pragmatic solutions.\" The clock is ticking, and every day without meaningful action puts more people and ecosystems at risk.\n\nWe need policymakers to take bold action now, not just rely on market forces or private sector initiatives alone. We require comprehensive policies that address the root causes of climate change, prioritize equity and justice, and drive innovation in clean technologies.\n\nLet's not underestimate the power of government to shape the future of our economy. By investing in renewable energy, sustainable practices, and international cooperation, we can create a more just and equitable transition for all.\n\nWe owe it to ourselves, our children, and future generations to take bold action on climate change. The time for debate is over; the time for action is now."
