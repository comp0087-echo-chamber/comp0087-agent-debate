They're a continuous process that can help individuals recognize and overcome their biases. We need to create a culture of accountability, where institutions are held responsible for addressing implicit bias in their practices.\"",

By educating and retraining individuals in positions of power, we create a ripple effect that can influence policy and institutional decisions, ultimately driving systemic change.\"\n \n(I'll wait for your next response to continue the conversation)",

For instance, a police department with body cameras and de-escalation training is more likely to be implemented if officers are educated on implicit bias and its effects. This creates a feedback loop where individual actions inform policy changes.\""

It's not enough to 'retrain' officers without addressing the underlying issues of funding and resources.\""
