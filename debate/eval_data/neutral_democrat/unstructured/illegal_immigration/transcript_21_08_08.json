Shouldn't we prioritize those who followed the law and are now contributing to society, rather than rewarding those who broke it?\"",
        "round_2": "\"Those guidelines would still create loopholes and encourage people to exploit the system. What about those who don't meet these requirements? Would we deny citizenship to someone who's been contributing to society for years, just because they didn't follow the law at the time of entry?\"",
        "round_3": "\"Mike's suggestion of a tiered pathway acknowledges the complexities of individual circumstances. However, it also risks creating a system where some people are rewarded for breaking the law while others aren't. How do we ensure that those who followed the law and contributed to society are prioritized over those who didn't?\"",
        "round_4": "\"I see Mike's point about prioritizing those who have contributed to society, but what about the issue of chain migration? If we grant citizenship to undocumented immigrants, wouldn't they be able to sponsor family members from their home countries, potentially leading to a surge in new arrivals and straining our resources even further?\""

        "round_0": "I disagree with the idea that stricter border enforcement is the only solution. We should also focus on providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, allowing them to contribute to our economy and society while paying taxes. This approach promotes integration and reduces social tensions.",
        "round_1": "\"I agree that national security is a concern, but a pathway to citizenship wouldn't create an incentive for illegal entry. It's about treating those already here as part of the solution, not the problem. This approach also encourages people to come through official channels, reducing the risk of human trafficking and smuggling.\"",
        "round_2": "\"I understand Sam's concern about setting a precedent, but we can establish clear guidelines for eligibility. For example, undocumented immigrants could be required to pass a background check, pay back taxes, and demonstrate proficiency in English and U.S. history. This approach balances fairness with accountability.\"",
        "round_3": "\"That's a valid concern, Sam, but we can't dismiss the value of second chances. Denying citizenship to those who've contributed to society would be unfair and counterproductive. Instead, we could establish a 'pathway' with multiple tiers, allowing those who meet certain criteria to earn citizenship over time, rather than all at once.\"",
        "round_4": "\"I agree that fairness is crucial. To address this concern, we could implement a 'merit-based' approach, where undocumented immigrants who have made significant contributions to their communities, such as through volunteer work or entrepreneurship, can be fast-tracked for citizenship. This way, we prioritize those who have demonstrated value and commitment to American society.\""
