We can't just focus on individual actions or education alone; we need to address the systemic inequalities that perpetuate racism.

It's not enough to 'retrain' officers without addressing the underlying issues of funding and resources.\""}, {"agent_id": 0, "response": "\"I see your point about the need for systemic changes, Mike, but we can't dismiss the impact of individual actions on policy decisions. For instance, a police department with body cameras and de-escalation training is more likely to be implemented if officers are educated on implicit bias and its effects. This creates a feedback loop where individual actions inform policy changes.\""}]}
