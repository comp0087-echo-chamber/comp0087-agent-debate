        "turn_1": "\"I've reconsidered my stance, Mike. While I agree that national security is important, I think your concerns about the economy might be overstated. A more nuanced approach could balance job protection for citizens with incentives for highly skilled immigrants who can drive growth and innovation. We need a balanced system.\"",
        "turn_2": "\"I see Mike's point about preserving national character, but I still think we need a balanced approach.

        "turn_1": "\"I strongly disagree, Bob. Stricter borders and enforcement ensure national security and protect American jobs. Lenient policies would lead to a surge in unauthorized migration, straining our resources and economy. We should focus on merit-based immigration that rewards skills and innovation, not open borders with no accountability.\"",
        "turn_2": "\"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but even with incentives, open borders still pose a threat to our culture and identity. A more lenient policy would give priority to family reunification over merit-based immigration, putting the needs of unskilled workers ahead of skilled ones. We can't lose sight of America's character.\"",
        "turn_3": "\"I appreciate Bob's willingness to consider a nuanced approach, but I still believe stricter borders are essential. We can't compromise on national security and job protection for American citizens. A balanced system that rewards innovation and skills is possible, but it must prioritize the needs of our country first.\"\n \n(Note: This response stays within the 50-word limit)",
        "turn_4": "\"I see Bob's compromise, but even with accountability measures, open borders still pose risks. What if highly skilled immigrants bypass those checks? We need to ensure our economy benefits American workers, not just attract foreign talent at any cost. Prioritizing our citizens' interests is key.\"",
        "turn_5": "\"I appreciate Bob's evolution on this issue, but I still firmly believe stricter borders are essential for national security and protecting American jobs. A merit-based system that rewards skills and innovation, not open borders with no accountability, is our best bet for a prosperous future.\"",
